# Predicting-Oil-Spot-Prices-Using-Time-Series-Data

Oil prices have a profound impact on global economies, influencing everything from
transportation costs to inflation rates. Accurate predictions of oil spot prices are
invaluable for investors, policymakers, and industries reliant on oil. By anticipating price fluctuations, stakeholders can make informed decisions to hedge risks, optimize supply chains, and implement appropriate fiscal policies. This project aims to explore a unique approach to forecasting using factors such as financial market indicators (e.g., S&P 500 Index, VIX), macroeconomic factors (e.g., interest rates, DXY Index), and daily headline sentiment scores, which are less explored in combination. The milestones document our progress in this project, explaining our completed work and plans every month.
